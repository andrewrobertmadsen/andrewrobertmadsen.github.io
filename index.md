# Welcome

Hey! I'm Andrew Madsen.

I'm a guy living in Salt Lake City, Utah with my wife and three kids just trying to keep it all together. 

I'm an avid skier, developer, datahead and Dad. I'm currently working at Pluralsight on their Data Engineering and Operations Team.

I have no clue what this site will be yet but maybe I'll have an lightning bolt of an idea here soon and we'll find some direction. Until then, best luck fellow earth traveller!
