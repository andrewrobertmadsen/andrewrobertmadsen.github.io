After more than a decade, I'm back on the slopes.

I grew up going snowboarding weekly through the program offered at my elementary school. It was a ton of fun and I continued snowboard my way through high school.

However, in college, with tight finances and ski pass costing 10x what they did as a k-12 student, I put the board down in favor of tuition. Fast forward through a bachlor's, a master's, three kids, and busy early career and I found myself at 35 struggling when introducing myself to come up with a single hobby. Blessed with a little more financial freedom then my college days and a with my youngest finally leaving the baby stage, I began to wonder what activity from my youth I might resume to loose the baby weight I had accrued. With some encouragement from my neighbor, I landed on skiing.

Skiing seemed like a return to the sport of my youth in a different form. I recalled riding the lift with skiers in their 60s and 70s when I was younger. As such, I was hopeful that maybe it would come easier to me after neglecting my body for the past decade. I bought myself a pass to the resort of my youth, Snowbird, and spent the next couple months spending all our extra income on ski gear.

The big day to hit the slopes was early in December 2020. I was a litle late getting up the canyon so against my better judgement I decided to take on big emma instead of chickadee. The lift ride up was awesome and I did okay until I got below the terrain park. From there, it was way too steep and I quickly realized 1) skiing is not the same as snowboarding, 2) I wasn't 18 anymore and 3) I had no business being there. After catching my breath, I popped my skis off, threw them over my shoulder and took the walk of shame down the rest of big emma. Once I was in view of the lift, the ski patrol kindly (but embarassing) kept uphill from me to make sure no one hit me. Once the ski hill started to level out, my pride took over and I decided to ride the rest of the run out. The ski patrol bid me farewell and I proceeded to ride spastically into a bush. With that final blow to my confidence, I hiked to the truck and headed home after the hour long ordeal.

On the way home I thought about my experince. To be honest, I wasn't surprised I sucked so bad. I showed up at home around 10:30 am, much earlier than my wife expected after I told her the lifts closed at 4 pm. She asked my how skiing was. I replied, after relating my sad tale, that it was awesome. Awesome not because I was amazing, but because I was back where I loved to be: back on the slopes amidst the trees and mountains. 

Since then, I have spent several weekends more paying my skiing dues on the bunny hill and other greens. I realized my boots were too big and traded them in for a size down. Crazyily enough, that made a huge difference (a post for a later date) and the last time out I was hard charging on blues almost like I used to on my snowboard. 

The bigger lesson to me, however, is how much joy I felt being reconnected with something I loved doing as an child and adolescent. I think as adults, one of the ways we measure ourselves is whether we are able to do for ourselves the things our parents provided to us as children. A coming full circle, if you will. It felt great to get to that place, revisit an old friend and start doing something for my emotional and physical health.
