After more than a decade, I'm back on the slopes.

I grew up going snowboarding weekly through the program offered at my elementary school. It was a ton of fun and I continued snowboard my way through high school.

However, in college, with tight finances and ski pass costing 10x what they did as a k-12 student, I put the board down in favor of tuition. Fast forward through a bachlor's, a master's, three kids, and busy early career and I found myself at 35 struggling when introducing myself to come up with a single hobby. Blessed with a little more financial freedom then my college days and a with my youngest finally leaving the baby stage, I began to wonder what activity from my youth I might resume to loose the baby weight I had accrued. With some encouragement from my neighbor, I landed on skiing.

Skiing seemed like a return to the sport of my youth in a different form. I recalled riding the lift with skiers in their 60s and 70s when I was younger. As such, I was hopeful that maybe it would come easier to me after neglecting my body for the past decade. I bought myself a pass to the resort of my youth, Snowbird, and spent the next couple months spending all our extra income on ski gear.
